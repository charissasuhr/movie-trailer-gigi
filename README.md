## Gigi Movie Trailer

Gigi follows the youngest girl in a family of Parisian cocottes (courtesans) who is taught to manipulate men—and not to, under any circumstances, marry them. But Gigi, of course, ends up breaking the cocottes’s code and shattering social norms—even by today’s standards. The idea of a teenage girl from a family of courtesans marrying an older man still raises eyebrows, perhaps more so now than it did in the 50s—though MGM’s Technicolor treatment almost makes it possible to miss that this is what the story’s really about.
